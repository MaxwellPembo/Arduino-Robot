# Embedded System Arduino Robot

# Objectives

The end goal of this project was to build a robot using an Arduino and other circuit components to have to the robot follow a wall and obstacles without hitting anything also to to implement functionality to the IR receiver on the robot so we can control it with a remote. While building the robot I will learn about the other components like the ultrasonic sensor and the servo and how they work. Learning about the internals of the Arduino was necessary to complete this project correctly, for example we needed to understand the Arduino timer to implement the remote control functionality. This lab was an example of what we can create using a Arduino using multiple components, and show the process of a project.
